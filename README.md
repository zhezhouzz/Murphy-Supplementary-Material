## Benchmarks

There are details of `16` benchmarks which are shown in folders with the same name of the benchmark under "benchmarks" folder.
Each benchmark has a file `buggy.ml` which presents the buggy target program and a file `correct.ml` present the correct version. Then `assertion.ml` shows the pre- and post-condition, the ADT, the underline algebraic data type representation (which indicates the perturbation operators), initial buggy input, and parameters required by Murphy: the sampling bound and number of statements in a perturbation function `m`.

## Results

The synthesized two perturbation functions are shown folder "results".
